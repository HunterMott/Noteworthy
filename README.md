- Styled to look clean and minimal.

#### PostMVP

## Project Schedule

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|December 3| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|December 4| Project Approval / Core Structure | Incomplete
|December 7| Psudo Code / Actual Code | Incomplete
|December 8| Majority of app functioning | Incomplete
|December 9| Style and finishing touches | Incomplete
|December 10| MVP | Incomplete
|December 11| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
