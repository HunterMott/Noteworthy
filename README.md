### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Clean and efficent code.
- Add and remove items on a to do list.
- Add edit and remove notes in a note section.
- Navagation bar to get around the site.
- Styled to look clean and minimal.

#### PostMVP  

- Implement drag and drop on my to do list.
- Implement a calander to add appointments and meetings.
- Use a react library.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I have a strong understanding of react and JavaScript, I think that will carry me through this project to a solid finished project.

### Weaknesses: Some more advanced things in react are still a bit iffy, they will create some roadblocks and issues.

### Opportunities: This is a great oppritunity to solidify my react knowledge and really show myself what I have learned.

### Threats: There is a good chance that I run into issues that take much longer than expected to work around and solve. This could kill a bunch of time.
